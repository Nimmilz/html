	<h2><u> Becoming a Standup comedian</u></h2>

		<img src="html/photo.jpg"/>
			<hr/>with the beginning of the covid pandemic we were all stuck at our homes.I was an Industrial Engineering student at Ben Gurion University,
			the lockdown made me take a break for a second and think, I realized that I am wasting my life not trying to
			pursue the career I actually want. So I decided to chase my real dreams and to stop living out of fear just because i want to be financially stable.
			April 2020 that is the date i decided to become a stand up comedian and so far I am loving every aspect of it.
			the origins of comedy can be seen in ancient greece with the "father of comedy" the famous philosopher 
			<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" target = "_blank">Aristotle</a> who is known as the tutor of Alexander the Great.
			<p>
			Stand-up comedy in the United States got its start from monologists performing stump-speech monologues from within the minstrel shows of the early
			19th century. It also has roots in various traditions of popular entertainment of the late 19th century, including vaudeville, 
			English music hall, burlesque or early variety shows, humorist monologues by personalities such as Mark Twain, and circus clown antics.
			With the turn of the century and spread of urban and industrial living, the structure, pacing and timing, and material of 
			American humor began to change. Comedians of this era often depended on fast-paced joke delivery, slapstick, outrageous or 
			lewd innuendo, and donned an ethnic persona—African, Scottish, German, Jewish—and built a routine based on popular stereotypes.
			During the stand-up eras of minstrel, vaudeville, and burlesque, jokes were generally considered to be in the public domain and 
			humorous material was widely shared, appropriated, and stolen. Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment 
			as a way to escape and confront city living. A precursor to stand-up, the era of burlesque comedy used satirical and blue humor to 
			appeal to men</p>
			Israeli stand up started around the 80's with only Israeli's as the audience. Slowly but surely with the golbalization of the world 
			we can see newer comedians being influenced by international comedy, mostly by the USA. Big names like:
